The goal of this project was to receive the input of a date and a string from the command line, require that the date be a future date from whatever the current date is. Then pass the string via an "execl" call to get the SHA512 hash of a string. We then use a thread to pass the date to a thread function and calculate the remaining days from the current date to the future date. The goal of this project was to practice working with processes and threads.
